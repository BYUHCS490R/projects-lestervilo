    <h1>Hi, my name is John Doe</h1>
    <p> I am an IT major and currently studying here in BYU-Hawaii. I like to watch anime such as, My Hero Academia, Attack on Titan, and Demon Slayer. I also like to read books as a hobby. My favorite books to read are fiction novels, like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and The Lord of the Rings. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. <strong>Reading</strong> is one of my favorite pastimes, and I often find myself lost in a good story.</p>
    <p>In the future, I hope to become a software developer and work for a tech company. I want to create applications that can help make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to learning and growing in my field. I want to get married in the temple after I graduate. There are a lot of challenges in life, but I am determined to overcome them. I have three goals in life: <em>to love</em> my family, <i>to serve</i> my community, and <strong>to grow</strong> in my career. But my priority for now are:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Get married in the temple.</li>
        <li>Work for a tech company.</li>
        <li>Have a family.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Another important aspect of my life is <strong>volunteering</strong> in my community. I believe that giving back is essential for personal growth and happiness. I often participate in local events and help those in need. &lt;3</p>
